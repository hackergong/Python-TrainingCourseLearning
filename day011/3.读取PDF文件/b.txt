T h e squa re suppo r t of a n r x r d ig i ta l image is pa r t i t ioned in to 
non-overlapping 
squa re range cells' of two different sizes; thu s 
forming a two-level 
squa re pa r t i t ion . T h e larger cells-of

referred t o as (range) pa ren t cells; th e smaller ones-of

(range) child cells. A pa ren t cell can be sp l i t in to four 
non-overlapping child cells. T h e ac tua l construction of a pa r t i t ion , 
given a n original image t o encode, is discussed in section 111. All along 
th i s pape r , th e image pa r t i t ion will be denoted {B i} iEC , where C is 
t h e se t of a l l range blocks indices. 

Ab s t rac t 
A novel approach t o d ig i ta l image coding, rooted in I te ra ted 
T ran s fo rma t ion Theo ry , and referred t o as ITT -ba sed coding, is 
proposed. I t is a f r a c t a l block-coding me thod which relies on th e 
assumption 
t h a t 
image redundancy can be efficiently exploited 
through block s e l f - t r a n s f o rm a b i l i t y . 
T h e coding-decoding system is based on th e construction, for 
any given original image t o encode, of a n image t ran s fo rma t ion of a 
special kind which, when i te ra ted on any in i t ia l image, produces a 
sequence of images t h a t converges t o a f rac ta l app rox ima t ion of the 
original. T h e requirements on the t ran s fo rma t ion a r e t h a t ( i ) i t is

I INTRODUCT ION 
T h e past few years have seen the rise of various block-coding 
me thod s for th e compression of d ig i ta l images. Modern techniques 
essentially revolve a round th e areas of transform coding [7] and vector 
quan t iza t ion [2 ,6 ] . 
In 
th i s paper, we propose a novel 
image block-coding 
technique. 
I t 
is rooted 
in a ma thema t ica l 
theory of I te ra ted 
T ran s fo rma t ion s [3,4]. T h e 
t ran s fo rma t ion s considered here a re 
discrete, con t rac t ive image t ran s fo rma t ion s defined blockwise. 
Given a n original image, the encoding procedure is t o find 
among a class of contractive t ran s fo rma t ion s specified a p r i o r i , one 
which leaves the original image app rox ima te ly inva r ian t . We call such 
a transformation a f rac ta l code. I t ha s th e fundamen ta l property t h a t , 
when i te ra ted on any in i t ia l image, it produces a sequence of images 
which converges t o a f rac ta l image-the 
decoded image-visually 
close t o th e original. 
In section I1 we propose a class of t ran s fo rma t ion s . In section 
I11 we present a n au tom a t ed ITT -ba sed coding procedure. In section 
IV we address the decoding of an image from a f rac ta l code, and show 
how t o compu te bit rates. In section V we present coding s imu la t ion s 
and compare ou r technique with vector quan t iza t ion , on a theoretical 
level. 

'I A 
OF 
IMAGE TRANSFoRMAT1oNS 
In 
th i s section, we define a class of discrete 
image 
t ran s fo rma t ion s which will be used t o r e p r e s e n t or encode d ig i ta l 
images. These t ran s fo rma t ion s a re defined blockwise, consistently with 
a pa r t i t ion of th e image suppo r t , and a re con t rac t ive with respect t o 
the L, metric.

Let S(io,j,,,B) denote th e squa re cell of size B x B , with bo t tom 
left corner a t th e intersection of image row io and image column j,. 
Let p be a n original r x r image, and ji be a n app rox ima t ion of p. Let 
p ( S ) , j i ( S ) deno te their restrictions t o th e cell S(i,,j,,,B). T h e L, or 
root-mean-square 
( rm s ) d i s to r t ion between th e image blocks p ( S ) 
and p ( S ) is defined as the squa re root of the sum , over the cell, of th e 
squared differences of pixel values, i.e.
